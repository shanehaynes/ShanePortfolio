    <h2>Exploring the Great Outdoors</h2>
    <p class="outdoor-paragraph">
      Most my time spent away from a laptop is spent under the sun, even if transitively by way of thick cloud or fog. 
      There is no cathedral more sublime, no crucible more stern, than the untouched majesty of the natural world. 
      My adventures are frequently made better by doing it with fantastic people.

      <h2>Philosophy & Literature</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy spending my spare evenings and any down time reading literature and studying philosophy. 
        My engagement with classic written works continues to feed my insatiable curiosity for gaining a better understanding 
        of the wild ride that is the human experience. My favorite novels include The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky 
        and Dune by Frank Herbert, while the philosophies of Søren Kierkegaard and Albert Camus have exerted the strongest 
        influence on my worldview.
        <br></br>
        I have never been one to turn down a lively discussion about philosophy or great works of literature so if that excites you 
        as well, please reach out!
